Parameters available:

total_chips         Total among all player
tounament_length    Total time in minutes
  also: max_time_over
time                Time on this turn
first_small_blind   First small blind, should never be less


Requirements:

blinds must increase in each round
blinds should similarily compare to their neighbours
  i.e. 50-100% more than than last blind and 50-100% less than next blind
blinds at t = tournament_length should be ~5% of total chips
blinds at t = tournament_length+max_time_over should be ~ 25% of total_chips

Possible functions:

small_blind = (((tournament_length/60)*(x**3.65))/(total_chips*2))+(first_small_blind)

Works for small groups (~8), risks not increasing each turn
