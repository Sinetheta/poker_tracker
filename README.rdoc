== Poker Tracker

Poker Tracker is a Ruby on Rails application for tracking poker games.

It allows you to have user and guest account that can participate in
games that user's set up.

Games will automatically track the blinds and give you timers for each round.

During the game, players can "go out" and when everybody but the winner has gone
out, the game winner will be declared.

The game history is archived, and a leaderboard is calculated.
