Why does the `before_validation on: [:create, :update]` run twice on updates?

Turns out that you don't need to also obj.save when you obj.update_attributes()


The model is rounding all non-integer game_length values. This is happening before
validation, so it must be from the form?
I think the problem must in the schema, game_length might have to be able to
accept a floating point. I can validate it as an integer, but it might still
have to be saved in the db as a floating point.
