Todo:

We should look at adding accounts and associating them with games so that users can be tracked/scored.

More Javascript can be done to make the timers more useful.
An "in game" screen with visual information meant to be displayed during the game.

Mark games "completed" and view them in an archive.
Allow games to be ended and have a winner declared.

Why does the `before_validation on: [:create, :update]` run twice on updates?
It doesn't, unless you also obj.save when you obj.update_attributes()
But now, it's firing when we update the round

The model is rounding all non-integer game_length values. This is happening before
validation, so it must be from the form? (it's not, it's because of the schema)
game_length might have to be able to accept a floating point.
I can validate it as an integer, but it will be saved as a floating point.
