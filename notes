Todo:

Now that we have a timer going, we should be able to detect when it's done and
give some options about moving to the next round.
We should be able to continue to track current round information in the db
and give an ability to suspend games.

We should probably also look at adding accounts and associating them with games
so that users can be tracked/scored.

Is it something with turbolinks that is causing the script to continue to run (and break)
when I've naviagted away?

It would be good to figure out why the timer doesn't reset to 900?
