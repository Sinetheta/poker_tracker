We should look at adding accounts and associating them with games so that users can be tracked/scored.

Mark games "completed" and view them in an archive.
Allow games to be ended and have a winner declared.
  I think just by having a winner declared, they can be considered completed.

An "in game" screen with visual information meant to be displayed during the game.
  This is getting there, how can I improve it's aesthetic and function?

The solution is to hold game_length in hours in the db and
then convert it to minutes for calculations when necessary
